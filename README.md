# Higher Mathematics
The course on Higher Mathematics forms part of the Water Engineering Master and is offered in the first (winter) semester.

The course has four main components:
- statistics
- functions
- differential equations
- matrices and optimization

## Statistics

In statistics the extreme value estimation is presented introducing the important probability distributions for extreme values, the skewness as the third moment. The identification of probability distributions, the estimation of their moments and parameters and the application for extreme value estimation are practiced.
