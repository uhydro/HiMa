# Higher Mathematics
The course on Higher Mathematics forms part of the Water Engineering Master and is offered in the first (winter) semester.

The course has four main components:
- statistics
- functions, differentiation and integration
- differential equations
- matrices and optimization

## Statistics

In statistics the extreme value estimation is presented introducing the important probability distributions for extreme values, the skewness as the third moment. The identification of probability distributions, the estimation of their moments and parameters and the application for extreme value estimation are practiced. 

## Functions

In relation to functions the application of optimization methods is described such as the Newton-Raphson method. Important functions in hydrology and water resources engineering are introduced such as the Gamma function, the error function, the exponential function and logarithms. 

## Differential equations

The use of differential equations in water engineering is described. This part of the lecture refers to the excellent book of Soetert on Differential equations. The use of DE in compartment modeling, is described in more detail. Important differential equations in soil physics, river routing, groundwater flow are discussed.
